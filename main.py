# This file should have one main function which takes this as input: https://github.com/DARPA-CRITICALMAAS/cdr_schemas/blob/main/cdr_schemas/prospectivity_input.py#L128
# and produces this: https://github.com/DARPA-CRITICALMAAS/cdr_schemas/blob/main/cdr_schemas/prospectivity_input.py#L112 as output for each input layer including the raster product.

# Need an additional function to take the CSV of training points (TA2) and rasterize as a binary for modeling target.

# Need to integrate CDR API's to create and point to TA1 feature packages.
